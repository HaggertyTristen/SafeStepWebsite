    <h2>About SafeStep</h2>
    <p>SafeStep is a cutting-edge wearable AI detection system designed to save lives in mine-contaminated regions. Integrated into smart boots and ankle devices, it leverages computer vision and deep learning (AlexNet) to identify landmines and other buried explosives in real time. The system delivers instant haptic (vibration) and visual alerts, keeping operators safe in environments where traditional methods are slow, dangerous, and error-prone.</p>

    <p>Over 60 countries remain contaminated by landmines, posing ongoing risks to military personnel, humanitarian demining teams, and civilians. Manual detection methods require extensive human intervention, exposing personnel to life-threatening situations. SafeStep drastically reduces detection time while minimizing the risk of casualties, providing both operational efficiency and peace of mind.</p>

    <p>The system combines advanced AI with a practical wearable form factor. Each camera frame captured by the boot-mounted device is analyzed through a trained AlexNet model, capable of distinguishing between "safe" and "mine" terrain patterns. Alerts are triggered immediately when confidence thresholds are exceeded, allowing operators to react before stepping into danger.</p>

    <p>SafeStep’s applications extend beyond military operations. Humanitarian organizations, post-conflict recovery teams, and civilian mine-clearing initiatives can deploy the system to accelerate cleanup operations and reduce preventable deaths. The technology also supports diverse terrains, lighting conditions, and environmental factors, thanks to rigorous dataset training and continuous model refinement.</p>

    <p>From a development perspective, SafeStep is engineered with scalability in mind. While the current prototype costs around $1,500, mass production targets under $400 per unit. Revenue pathways include military contracts, NGO partnerships, licensing agreements, and government safety programs, with a long-term vision to establish SafeStep Technologies, Inc. as the industry leader in wearable mine detection.</p>

    <p>By merging cutting-edge AI with real-world practicality, SafeStep represents a life-saving innovation at the intersection of technology, defense, and humanitarian impact. With continued development and proper funding, SafeStep has the potential to save countless lives worldwide.</p>
