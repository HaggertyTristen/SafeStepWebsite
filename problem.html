      <h2>Global Mine Contamination</h2>
      <p>
        Landmines remain a deadly legacy of past conflicts. Over 60 countries are still contaminated with active mines, affecting millions of civilians and field personnel. Despite international efforts, detection and removal remain slow and dangerous.

      <h2>Current Detection Methods</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual probing with metal detectors – very slow</li>
        <li>Sniffer dogs – effective but costly</li>
        <li>Ground-penetrating radar – expensive and bulky</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These methods put personnel at high risk, with many casualties occurring every year due to undetected mines or human error.

      <h2>Humanitarian Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Mines block farmland, destroy communities, and prevent post-conflict recovery. SafeStep not only saves operator lives but accelerates the clearance process for civilians, NGOs, and military personnel.
