      <h2>Global Mine Contamination</h2>
      <p>
        Over 60 countries remain contaminated by landmines. Current detection methods are manual, slow, and force personnel into life-threatening situations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual Detection: Dangerous and time-consuming</li>
        <li>Field Casualties: Preventable deaths among military and humanitarian personnel</li>
        <li>Slow Recovery: Landmine contamination delays post-conflict rebuilding</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Humanitarian and Military Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Landmines continue to kill or injure thousands every year. Clearing them is hazardous, and traditional methods cannot scale quickly enough to save lives.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Military EOD units and combat engineers face high-risk operations</li>
        <li>NGO demining and post-conflict civilian teams are vulnerable</li>
      </ul>
